Making friends as a commuter
commute, socializing, academics, making friends
For me the most difficult part of coming to college was not making many friends
because of my living situation. Since I commute to UC Davis from Sacramento, I
never experienced the dorm life. Many of my closest friends were from high school
and even though I met some friends through classes I felt like I had to work to find
lab partners and people to be in study groups with. But once I started to push my
boundaries and talk to people before and after classes and exchange contact
information, it was easier to form study groups. I also went to some social activities
and joined the Picnic Day Board of Directors. Now I have met other people, some of
whom are now as close as my friends in high school were.
