Contributing in classes
transfer, large class, academics, from a junior
Coming in to UC Davis as a transfer student was overwhelming. Walking into huge
auditorium classes for the first time was uncomfortable. And in smaller classes, I
wasn’t sure I had anything interesting to say. Sometimes small class discussions felt
over my head and I didn’t know when to speak up. But now I feel much more
relaxed. I’ve realized that we are all learning and are not expected to have the
perfect answer. We all contribute different viewpoints to the discussion and we
have a common goal –to share ideas and to learn and to grow to do cool things in the
future. We are all a part of that. Now I feel much more confident participating in
discussions, listening, and sharing my opinions.
