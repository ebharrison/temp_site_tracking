Worried about large classes
community college, transition, UWP, from a senior
I had small, close-knit classes in community college, so I worried I would not have
the same personal connection with my UC Davis professors or get help when I
needed it. And it did take time to get used to the large diverse college environment
at UC Davis. But eventually I saw that, just because there were more students, the
professors didn’t care less about me or think of me as just a number. My first year, I
had a tough writing assignment with UWP 01 Expository Writing, so I went to office
hours to talk with the professor. I showed her a draft and she was excited about the
ideas. I mean, it wasn’t great yet, but she showed me how I could take it to the next
level. Now that I’m a senior, I realized that in college sometimes you have to reach
out. Not everyone’s going to be receptive all the time, but many professors are eager
to work with students on subjects they love.
