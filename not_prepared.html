Not prepared for college
academics, belonging
Compared to other students, I worried that my high school wasn’t very good and
that maybe my high school classes hadn’t prepared me well enough. When I got to
UC Davis, I didn’t know what professors would be like or how to interact with them.
I felt out of place, and I worried that they or other students might judge me. So, I was
nervous speaking in class and I didn’t want other people to read my papers. But
after a while I began feeling more comfortable –I started to enjoy my classes more,
and I found some close friends I trusted. Sometimes I asked friends to look over my
papers for me. And I became more comfortable talking with professors. I saw that
professors are here to teach you, not judge you. And I saw that almost no one knows
what college will be like at first or feels comfortable right away. Everyone feels out
of place at first. It didn’t mean I didn’t belong. It took time, but now I feel at home at
UC Davis. I’m proud of how much I’ve grown now as a sophomore.
