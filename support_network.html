Building a support network
single-parent, low-income, workshop, academics 
Growing up in a single-parent, low-income household, I felt that part of me thought
that I might not measure up to the other students. My first year as a freshman, I
bombed a test in Calculus 17. It was the worst grade I’d ever received, and I felt
terrible and isolated. But then, I found out I wasn’t the only one. No one did well on
that test. It was really hard –the professor was trying to set a high standard. She
even knew it’d be tough, but she knew that if we worked hard we could get to that
level. So, I talked with my academic advisor, went to workshops and tutoring at the
Student Academic Success Center, and I finally started to believe that I was totally
up to par and could really succeed here. I still feel like I am still struggling to keep up
with the workload, but I know these are the kinds of things everybody feels on
occasion.
