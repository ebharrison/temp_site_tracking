Making new friends
first-generation, transition, socializing
As a senior, I love college and I wouldn’t trade my experiences at UC Davis for
anything. I’ve made some close friends and had some fantastic experiences, and I’ve
certainly learned a lot. Still, the transition to college can be difficult, and it was for
me. As a first-generation college student, I felt like I didn’t know what I was doing
during freshman year –I made a lot of casual friends at parties and other places but I
avoided interacting with professors in class or going to office hours. I think I was
intimidated by them. I also got some low grades early on, which stressed me out. But
these things got better over time. I began to make good friends through classes and
student organizations like the Birdstrike Theatre Improv team. And my grades got
better as I started working in study groups and asking for help from professors and
other instructors. I even got involved in a research project with my BIS2B professor.
I am happier than I have ever been at college. It is really rewarding for me to feel
like I belong in the intellectual community here.
