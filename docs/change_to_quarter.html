Changing to the Quarter System
quarter system, academics, transition
Before coming to college, I didn’t worry much about classes and grades, but during
my first year I felt unprepared for the workload and quarter system. It was a
learning experience. After getting burned grade-wise several times and feeling
stressed about the fast pace curriculum, I worried that I wasn’t smart enough.
Fortunately, a conversation with a Teaching Assistant in my Philosophy 005 class
set me straight –he told me that everyone struggles at first: you have to learn how to
study in college. I figured out how to budget my time more wisely, so I wouldn’t get
burned out at the end. And maybe even more important, I learned that when I get
stuck on a problem or an idea, it helps to talk with people –like a professor, peer
advisor, or even just a friend. Although my start was somewhat rocky, it has felt
good to learn from my mistakes, and I am proud of the successes I have had.
