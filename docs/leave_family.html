Leaving Family and Friends to come to UC Davis
home sick, extracurricular activity, academics, loneliness
Initially my transition to college was pretty easy. Hanging out with friends on
campus was fun, and I met a lot of people early on. But, although I met many
students, I felt like I didnâ€™t have many close friends like I did back at home. All of my
good friends were back home in China. During short breaks or holidays I usually
stayed indoors because everyone else visits their families. At first I felt sad, but I
started to be involved in extracurricular activities in my major, and I met people
who had common interests and unique perspectives. I also got to know people in my
General Psychology 001 class as study partners and now they have become close
friends. I found a comfort zone by exploring my interests and taking the leap into an
active life on campus. But this took time and before I found my niche here, there
were still times when I felt quite lonely.
