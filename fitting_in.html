Fitting in
transfer, person of color, transition
As a transfer student, I was so excited about coming to UC Davis. But sometimes I
was also worried I might be different from other students, particularly as a person
of color. And when I got to campus, sometimes it felt like everyone else was right at
home. Eventually, I figured out that almost everyone comes to college unsure
whether they will fit in or not. Once I realized that, I was able to push myself to
reach out and make friends and eventually found a good group of friends. It’s
ironic—everyone comes to college and feels they are different from everyone else
when, really, in at least some ways, we are all pretty similar.
